# Amp-game-server

Working on Docker image for amp game server.

## Why?
I kept running into issues where the docker container that was built by cubecoders is refusing to start. So, I'm building my own specifically so I can run it as a container in UNRAID.

## Building from manual install
 I'm building from manual install instructions located [here](https://cubecoders.com/AMPInstall). Based on the ubuntu LTS build.
